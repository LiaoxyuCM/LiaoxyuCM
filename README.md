- Nice to meet you!

### My story

1. On Mar 28th, I had an English exam. The nineth topic asked "What's your hobbies", I answered "coding", but it was wrong! I never answer "coding" again.
2. chrome://dino is **our** favourite game, we usually play it when we have a computer class
3. Maybe 2 years ago, I had a new friend, he is [çºªå¤±YYBH @YYBH-CRH](https://github.com/YYBH-CRH). He often research CPU, GPU, USB and more. One day, I asked him why didn't merge my branch on [my pull request](https://github.com/YYBH-CRH/YYBH.github.io/pull/4), he said his wifi couldn't connect to github.
He has about 50 email address, but about 40 email address was blocked because he opened GUI in some games.
4. Finally! I can access Github without watttokkit! It's so rare! \(I live in the mainland cn.\)
