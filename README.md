### My story

1. On Mar 28th, I had an English exam. The nineth topic asked "What's your hobbies", I answered "coding", but it was wrong! I never answer "coding" again.
2. chrome://dino is **our** favourite game, we usually play it when we have a computer class
3. Maybe 1 years ago, I had a new friend, he is [çºªå¤±YYBH @YYBH-CRH](https://github.com/YYBH-CRH). He often research CPU, GPU, USB and more
